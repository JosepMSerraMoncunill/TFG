\section{Scope}
The scope of this study is stated as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Review of the history and evolution of computational methods and techniques involving fluid dynamics and heat transfer (State-of-the art).
\item Introduction to the finite volumes methods as well as the mathematical knowledge required for solving the conservation equations.
\item Study of the equations of heat conduction in solids, laminar convection in unsteady conditions and radiation. If there is enough time, turbulent flow will be studied as well. 
\item Development of software using C++ language capable of solving benchmark problems such as the Smith-Hutton problem or the Lid Driven Cavity.
\item Validation and verification of the codes, as well as an analysis of convergence.
\item Study of a case in a particular field of interest and discussion on the results.
\item Optimization of the code.
\end{itemize}
