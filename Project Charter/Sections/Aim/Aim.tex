\section{Aim}
The main objective of this study is to acquire a deeper understanding of the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy, and to solve a variety of different problems involving heat transfer and fluid dynamics using numerical methods. A self-made code in C++ language will be created in order to solve these problems, and a verification of the results will be done comparing them with an analytical solution.\\
\\
Additionally, a particular case in an industrial or aeronautical application will be selected, and a code will be developed in order to solve this case. Verification of the results and optimization of the parameters will be done.
