\footnotetext{This task could start when task 2 finishes, but since the same person does all the tasks it is preferable to start task 9 when tasks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 finish}

\subsection{Calendar of the project}
In order to develop the calendar, is has been supposed that the working schedule will be from Monday to Friday, working 4 hours a day.
